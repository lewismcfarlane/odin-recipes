    <p><em><strong>Filet Mignon: A masterpiece of culinary perfection, a tender steak seared to perfection and bursting with rich, mouthwatering flavour.</strong></em></p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Filet Mignon steaks (6-8 oz each)</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Olive oil or clarified butter, for searing</li>
        <li>Fresh herbs, thyme or rosemary</li>
        <li>Garlic cloves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to cook</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preparation</strong>
            <ul>
            <li>Remove the filet mignon steaks from the fridge.</li>
            <li>Let the steaks sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes before cooking.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Season the steaks</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Season both sides of each steak generously with salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees Celsius. This step is essential for finishing the steaks after searing.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Sear the steaks</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Heat an oven-safe pan over high heat. Add a small amount of olive oil or clarified butter and swirl the pan to coat evenly.</li>
                <li>When the pan is hot and the oil is shimmering, carefully place the seasoned filet mignon steaks in the pan.</li>
                <li>Sear the steaks for about 2-3 minutes each side, or until a rich, golden-brown crust forms. For medium rare, the internal temperature should reach about 55-57 degrees Celsius. Adjust the cooking time based on your desired level of doneness.</li>
                <li>During the last minute of searing, add the herbs and garlic for additional flavour.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Finishing in the Oven</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Once the steaks are seared to your liking, transfer the pan with the steaks to the preheated oven.</li>
                <li>Roast the steaks in the oven for an additional 5 to 10 minutes, or until they reach your desired internal temperature. Use a meat thermometer to check the temperature.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Rest the Steaks</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Remove the pan from the oven, and transfer the steaks to a plate.</li>
                <li>Cover the steaks loosely with aluminum foil and let them rest for about 5 minutes. This resting period allows the juices to redistribute, ensuring a juicy and tender finish.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Serve</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>After resting, plate the filet mignon steaks and serve them as desired. They pair wonderfully with side dishes such as mashed potatoes, steamed greens, creamy spinach or a simple salad.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>This recipe will give you a tender, juicy filet mignon with a flavourful crust - perfect for a special meal or any occasion!</p>
